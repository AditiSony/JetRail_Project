# **Project- JetRail Traffic Prediction for next 7 months**

This is a learning project for exploratory analysis and predictive modelling for timeseries data. I have done this to learn concepts and gain hands knowledge on handling, analysing and modelling of timeseries data!

## **Source**
All data and source code are made available by Analytics Vidhya course titled “Time Series Forecasting Using Python” (link- https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/take/creating-time-series-forecast-using-python).

## **Folder Structure**
Train and Test file are stored in the data folder (note- Test file does not have labels as the data was part of a competition).
All source code is in the Jupyter file with all necessary dependencies mentioned in the importing libraries section. Please ensure you have these installed on your system. Also ensure to change the filepath for data files for your local system location.

## **Problem Statement**
Investors need to make investment in new form of transportation but they need to ensure that there will be sufficient (>1M monthly users) demand in next 18 months. Hence traffic forecast for next 7 months is the aim of this project.
